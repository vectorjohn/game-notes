Debrief with King of Solstice
-----------------------------
In the throne room.

We show the preserved Giant head. It impresses.

We learn of scrolls written before the founding of Kingdom of Agralissi talking of a *purple sky* around the forming of the kingdom.

King recognizes this as a BFD. Gives us a ship?

Ancient Scroll Room
-------------------
Agralissi used to be called Elenaris.
Ruler of Elenaris was queen Sarafina Galanodel.
Sky was turning purple because of a "change in dimensional conduits" between planes. We don't know what that means.
Author was not devoted to a single god, "fluid in who they praise". 
Author seemed to be a person chronicling events, not in some official capacity.
Elenaris was the one major town, it seemed like.

The new Boat!
-------------
Named: Ocean Serenity
Captain Lirael (Leery-al), a seasoned mariner.
Very fancy boat. Fast, graceful.
Big storage hold. Many snacks. Two private bars, running water, hot tub / sauna, outdoor grill.

(spoiler: the boat sank like right away while fighting a Krakken)

Items and Upgrades
------------------
I got Goggles of Night from Meriele. Level 15, note down price of upgrading them at half cost.
Upgrade what I need to at half price.
See if I actually have a slot for that.
Buy some Dual Arrows. I have to not use inherent bonuses if I get the level 15. So look at level 20 ones.

In Ildofarn(sp?)
----------------
In air chamber off throne room.
Sheloc Lenore says this chamber is where she last remembers being around/alive?
Found writing by the Queen, giving us this info:
    Caused by confluence of multiple dimensions.
    "I'm insuring my nursemaid Shel takes my daughter through a portal to safety or something".
    I.e. Shel was the nursemaid I guess.
    Suspects that the followers of Zugtmoy were influenced by a former lord of the house named Isah/Isaw/Esau. 
    There must be a temple unknown to her where the followers congregated. Followers of Zugtmoy have taken over the island and the Fey-gate.
Shel says Meriele must be a member of the royal family or something because only they should have been able to open the chamber.

Found about 200,000gp worth of treasure (gold and pearls and gems) after digging and chipping it out of coral.

Library in Ildofarn
-------------------
Learned about hidden temple of Zugtmoy under the city. 
**Clue:** In a book we read "Beneath the play of light an entry veiled in illusion beckons."
Majority of Ildofarn was Eladrin. Royal family was Eladrin. They were full of themselves.
Galanodel was the ruling family.
Governing hub for the world. Dominion of Elenaris (clearly precursor to Agralisi).
Dimensional gate called **Fey Gate** connected Ildofarn to Feywild. Cultural exchange between mortal world and Feywild, trade etc. It was like the Fey was a neighboring land. Corelan (god) worship was widespread. Most people didn't worship a single god, it was like Greek gods, people worshiped many for utilitarian reasons.

We found information about the **Temple of Elemental Evil**, the name of the temple under the city for Zugtmoy. Maybe somehow the library was used in recruitment for the *Followers of Zugtmoy*. 

**Clue:** We find the passage "Where subtle illumination caresses the void, a doorway cloaked in mystery may stir."
**Clue:** "Within the spectral convergeance of radiance and obscurity, the door may yield."
We found an address also, don't remember if Dave said what it was.
