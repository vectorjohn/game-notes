I gained +1 dexterity permanently. I added it but I'm not sure if it updated anything
on my sheet, so I may have to finally figure out my character info. Uh-oh.

I noticed I might not be counting bow expertise. It adds +1 feat bonus to attacks made with a bow. It might be overridden by a higher feat bonus on attacks.

In hero lab, I need these:
Savage world and core

Next chance, upgrade some stuff.
I have a level 5, 9, and 15 daily. I can replace either the 5 or 9 with a 19. Marked for death and splintering shot. 
Splintering shot is nice because it can reduce the damage of a boss for the whole time.
Marked for death, if I get it and focus on the enemy, could mean many hits of 2d8 extra damage.

Consider these:
**Unrestrained Aggression (19):**
Standard Action      Area burst 3 within 10 squares
Target: Each enemy in the burst
Effect: Using your Hunter's Quarry, you designate one target you can see as your quarry.
Attack: Dexterity vs. AC
Hit: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage.

Medium damage, but allows me to quarry any target in a burst (good for bosses like exactly
this one where they're covered in guys). Huge burst, I could easily see using it
on like 5 targets for massive damage.

**Barbed Arrows (19)**
Target: One or two creatures
Attack: Dexterity vs. AC. Make two attack rolls and use the higher result.
Hit: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and the target is weakened (save ends).
Aftereffect: The target takes ongoing 10 damage (save ends).

High chance to hit. Two targets is already pretty good damage, but they're also weakened.
Then, (almost) guaranteed +20 damage ongoing, and most likely 30.

**Surprising Arrow Stance (19)**
Daily   âœ¦     Martial, Stance, Weapon
Minor Action      Personal
Effect: Until the stance ends, as an immediate reaction when an enemy within 5 squares of you moves, you can use the Surprising Arrow Attack power.

Surprising Arrow Attack
Immediate Reaction      Ranged weapon
Target: The triggering enemy
Attack: Dexterity vs. AC
Hit: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and the target ends its movement.

Less good because of the clarification we just got on immediate reactions.
Within 5 of me, guys get shot at if they move. Decent damage and they stop moving. I suppose I can choose not to use it
so if there is one enemy I want to stay put, I can wait until it moves. But overall, I can somewhat expect
to be able to make a free 2W attack almost every round. Depending on the breaks.
This could be good even for solos, if the enemy wants to move or we can get the team to put him where he doesn't want to be, etc.

Dailies? 
Check out Flying Steel. For cases that are not that uncommon where there is nowhere to take cover, this could allow a free attack every turn. Now, it has to happen once just to break even. 

Notes in throne room
====================

people:
master of armory
cmdr
head of treasure
head of smithy
chief arch and eng
master of hunt / forest warden
seer (Aliya)
bard (Gladrielle star song)
grand master of order of knights

Aliya (sp?) the seer has a reputation for never having a false vision. But most people don't believe in future sight. 

In the realm of the giants, according to Gladrielle (bard)'s song, has a "false ground". Something about it makes us think it is maybe another realm. A "demi" realm.
