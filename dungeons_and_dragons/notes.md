==========
Updates before big in person game. 
I want to ~~replace Hunter Fighting Style~~ and Herbalist (I didn't realize Erevan already brews potions).

**I also might want to replace Bloodlust Strike?** Hard to believe, it was so good. But now Twin Strike (at will!) is up to 4d12+8 damage, and the risk of missing is distributed between two attacks. Bloodlust is only 3d12+16, all one attack. TS expected damage is `4*6.5+8=34, BLS is 3*6.5+16=35.5`, only 1.5 more damage. And it's riskier. And I can only use it on bloodied! I must be able to find something better.

Thoughts on Feats:
* **Martial Resolve** - make saving throws against a bunch of conditions at BOTH start and end of turn. 
* Martial Mastery - lets me recover something like Bloodlust Strike or Perfect aim. A few others.
* Robust Defenses - boring +2 to 3 of my defenses. Nice.
* Indomitable Will - useful, saves against daze and stun and extra will. Great! Boring, but good.

**Went with Martial Resolve.**
Retraining rules seem to indicate I can't retrain Hunter Fighting Style, it's a class feature. So Bloodlust Strike!

Thoughts on Bloodlust Strike:
Ask Dave if it's ok, but we leveled up twice last time so I should have been able to retrain twice. But maybe I can't have take backsies. **Hmm, actually** I might have retrained twice last time, I wrote "Added suprising arrow stance, replacing splintering shot" which sure sounds like I retrained. 
Options:
* Entrapping Arrows - Nice utility, has a decent chance of doing its job. 1W damage (burst 1), and if enemies try to leave I can do a 1W attack that stops their movement! This might be a use case for **Martial Mastery**, in that I could hold some baddies in place for two turns in a row.
  * OOPS - it's level 17, can't do it. But damn, it might be better than suppressing shots. I might like it more

==========
(In Roll20) Updated bloodlust strike, spikes of the manticore, twin strike, ranged basic.
Still other updates to make. I added the variables inherent-attack and inherent-defense. Thing is, I can't understand how to calculate an attack. E.g. `bloodlust strike` says Dex Vs. AC. What does that mean? Because my dex is 24. When I remove the magic number attack bonus, hero lab comes up with +22. Where does 22 come from? It knows my dex. Inherent bonuses are 4, and the bow adds +3, which seems like it should be (24 + 4 + 3) = 31. But of course, HL says 29.

Replace Hunter Fighting Style

2024-01-06
==========
* Added daily Surprising Arrow Stance, replacing splintering shot
* `Retrained` feat Preternatural Senses to Haunted
* Feats added: Far thought, Herbalist, Second Shot
* added +2 more to greatbow attack because I think I was off by one in Hero Lab, and at L21 I got another +1 from the greatbow.

**Sleuthing around Titan's Hold.**
(The Giant city where we are disguised as giants.)

Found Giant Children's Book About the Citadel from Titan's Hold merchant (Grimwald) in the Bazaar. Chatted up the wise old stone giant book seller (Grimwald), talking conspiracies etc. He said this book is fiction but has a grain of truth about the Citadel.

TODO at the Bazaar:
-------------------
- Ask our friend's name at the Bazaar. (Grimwald)
- Ask him about a book of geography. Or a map or something. 
- Ask him about books of fictitious gods (of chaos?)
  - Maybe try and determine if we can ask about Tharizdun directly.
  - (he says no, we have books about the creator Annam) 
- Look for a place that sells maps.

Meriele and Erevan in the Library
---------------------------------
Legend of a lost art of creating an Ice Ax.
With this, one might be able to summon Xixecal, a huge giant glacier that could walk around the world and destroy anything. Big baddie. Aligns with Ferd's vision?
No mention of Tharizdon.

Industrial District
-------------------
**Borin** the Blacksmith in the industrial district is worried about upcoming war. He's making a lot of weapons, including "child sized" weapons, and they're shipping to unknown locations. He seems worried about possibility that the King is going to start a war (doesn't seem to know about mortal realm).

In the Artsy District
---------------------
Thein (a stone giant) the sculptor who makes some magical stuff. He carves things from stone, statues, etc, that have magical powers but he doesn't really know he's doing it. He thinks of it as if he's bringing out the magic that's already there.
He mentioned something about not having dabbled in Golem making since the Citadel was remodeled 100 years ago.
He asks "You're not from Ironsville, are you?". Ironsville attacked the city (Titan's Hold) 100 years ago. Titan's Hold made Golems for guardians.

Carved Pine Marten
------------------
1-3 pound little critter, made out of obsidian hands that Gorran was carrying around. Gorran gave him the other hand as a thank you.
He is like a Welbie!
Or a house cat. No attacks, he's not as dangerous as Welbie. 
Think of a name. Consider "Keith". Or "Timon".


2021-07-16
==========
I gained +1 dexterity permanently. I added it but I'm not sure if it updated anything
on my sheet, so I may have to finally figure out my character info. Uh-oh.

2021-09-03
==========
I noticed I might not be counting bow expertise. It adds +1 feat bonus to attacks made with a bow. It might be overridden by a higher feat bonus on attacks.

In hero lab, I need these:
Savage world and core

2022-04-21
==========
Next chance, upgrade some stuff.
I have a level 5, 9, and 15 daily. I can replace either the 5 or 9 with a 19. Marked for death and splintering shot. 
Splintering shot is nice because it can reduce the damage of a boss for the whole time.
Marked for death, if I get it and focus on the enemy, could mean many hits of 2d8 extra damage.

Consider these:
**Unrestrained Aggression (19):**
Standard Action      Area burst 3 within 10 squares
Target: Each enemy in the burst
Effect: Using your Hunter's Quarry, you designate one target you can see as your quarry.
Attack: Dexterity vs. AC
Hit: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage.

Medium damage, but allows me to quarry any target in a burst (good for bosses like exactly
this one where they're covered in guys). Huge burst, I could easily see using it
on like 5 targets for massive damage.

**Barbed Arrows (19)**
Target: One or two creatures
Attack: Dexterity vs. AC. Make two attack rolls and use the higher result.
Hit: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and the target is weakened (save ends).
Aftereffect: The target takes ongoing 10 damage (save ends).

High chance to hit. Two targets is already pretty good damage, but they're also weakened.
Then, (almost) guaranteed +20 damage ongoing, and most likely 30.

**Surprising Arrow Stance (19)**
Daily   âœ¦     Martial, Stance, Weapon
Minor Action      Personal
Effect: Until the stance ends, as an immediate reaction when an enemy within 5 squares of you moves, you can use the Surprising Arrow Attack power.

Surprising Arrow Attack
Immediate Reaction      Ranged weapon
Target: The triggering enemy
Attack: Dexterity vs. AC
Hit: 2[W] + Dexterity modifier damage, and the target ends its movement.

Less good because of the clarification we just got on immediate reactions.
Within 5 of me, guys get shot at if they move. Decent damage and they stop moving. I suppose I can choose not to use it
so if there is one enemy I want to stay put, I can wait until it moves. But overall, I can somewhat expect
to be able to make a free 2W attack almost every round. Depending on the breaks.
This could be good even for solos, if the enemy wants to move or we can get the team to put him where he doesn't want to be, etc.

Dailies? 
Check out Flying Steel. For cases that are not that uncommon where there is nowhere to take cover, this could allow a free attack every turn. Now, it has to happen once just to break even. 

Notes in throne room
====================

people:
master of armory
cmdr
head of treasure
head of smithy
chief arch and eng
master of hunt / forest warden
seer (Aliya)
bard (Gladrielle star song)
grand master of order of knights

Aliya (sp?) the seer has a reputation for never having a false vision. But most people don't believe in future sight. 

In the realm of the giants, according to Gladrielle (bard)'s song, has a "false ground". Something about it makes us think it is maybe another realm. A "demi" realm.
