----------
Gas Canister - we agreed that "end of my next four turns" includes the turn I play the card.
Took a screenshot of card usage.
We ended at the end of a round. I was thinking I would long rest because I'm invisible and the enemies seem to go fast. So I could help waste their turn. I could do otherwise and if they clump up I have AOE but this might be a marathon. Also remember stamina potion to possibly stretch things out.
I'm at 13hp, 6xp, 3gold.
