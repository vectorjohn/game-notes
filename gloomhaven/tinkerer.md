Gas Canister - we agreed that "end of my next four turns" includes the turn I play the card.
Took a screenshot of card usage.
We ended at the end of a round. I was thinking I would long rest because I'm invisible and the enemies seem to go fast. So I could help waste their turn. I could do otherwise and if they clump up I have AOE but this might be a marathon. Also remember stamina potion to possibly stretch things out.
I'm at 13hp, 6xp, 3gold.

Nothing to add.

Choosing Curative Aerosols.
I got a checkmark which filled a trio for a new thingy.
I also noticed I forgot to get a perk for leveling. So next game I should get 
two new perks (I have not chosen them yet).

For perks I chose another remove 2 -1 cards and replace one -2 with +0.

We paused, I have:
7hp, 7xp, 3g.
I am *fairly sure* I ended on a gold piece, and that I forgot to count it, so that I have a total of 3.

My ideas for next few turns:
1. Move 4 in, basic attack the imp, then either
  a. Long rest so I can choose to lose the flame and get goggles+boots. This allows me to for sure get in the room and drop the contraption.
  b. Short rest, and I just can't lose stamina boost. I can move 4 in assuming the night demon gets out of the way. Then rush in and drop contraption and cloak.
2. Do damage somehow. Two scenarios:
  a. I stick to my goals, I'm out of real damage so I can only really stun, poison, and heal. Not bad as support. 
  b. I ditch the goals, which lets me do crank and toxic for ~11 damage. If I long rested, that could be more with gogs. Then flamethrower could help thin the demon herd.

I think 2a is fine. I won't do no damage, so we're only talking a handful of damage and for two checks.
