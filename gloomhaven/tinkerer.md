Gas Canister - we agreed that "end of my next four turns" includes the turn I play the card.
Took a screenshot of card usage.
We ended at the end of a round. I was thinking I would long rest because I'm invisible and the enemies seem to go fast. So I could help waste their turn. I could do otherwise and if they clump up I have AOE but this might be a marathon. Also remember stamina potion to possibly stretch things out.
I'm at 13hp, 6xp, 3gold.

Nothing to add.

Choosing Curative Aerosols.
I got a checkmark which filled a trio for a new thingy.
I also noticed I forgot to get a perk for leveling. So next game I should get 
two new perks (I have not chosen them yet).

2021-06-26
----------
For perks I chose another remove 2 -1 cards and replace one -2 with +0.

We paused, I have:
7hp, 7xp, 3g.
I am *fairly sure* I ended on a gold piece, and that I forgot to count it, so that I have a total of 3.

My ideas for next few turns:
1. Move 4 in, basic attack the imp, then either
  a. Long rest so I can choose to lose the flame and get goggles+boots. This allows me to for sure get in the room and drop the contraption.
  b. Short rest, and I just can't lose stamina boost. I can move 4 in assuming the night demon gets out of the way. Then rush in and drop contraption and cloak.
2. Do damage somehow. Two scenarios:
  a. I stick to my goals, I'm out of real damage so I can only really stun, poison, and heal. Not bad as support. 
  b. I ditch the goals, which lets me do crank and toxic for ~11 damage. If I long rested, that could be more with gogs. Then flamethrower could help thin the demon herd.

I think 2a is fine. I won't do no damage, so we're only talking a handful of damage and for two checks.


**Don't get any more XP!**

I forgot, the contraption is worth 2xp so there was no chance of getting that battle goal.
So I guess I did 2b. But I thought I was doing 2a and lost the flamethrower. Oh well. Lost me
maybe 2xp.

2021-08-14

I have 1gp.

Just finished long rest. I could change my mind on the loss card but I don't think I will.
The traps are 5 damage, no stun.
We could let Leeroy take damage, I can wound one golem.

LONG shot I could pull the far golem to me, then next turn wound both.
I'd want to go fast so the golem doesn't hit someone else or get away, then maybe gas can. 
Then basically move fast after the flame.

Something to consider, we don't have to fight the golems now. I could drop a contraption and we run past, do whatever happens in the next room(s), then come back (or better they follow slowly).

Got a check (counted above).
